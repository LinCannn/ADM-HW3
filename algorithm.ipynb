The goal is to collect all $n$ packages with the fewest moves, choosing the lexicographically smallest path if multiple shortest paths exist.\n",

    "### **Prove the correctnees of the algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Induction\n",
    "We’ll try to demonstrate that by following the path generated by the algorithm, the robot can collect all packages in order without violating movement constraints, and if a package cannot be reached, the algorithm correctly detects this and returns `\"NO\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Base Case \n",
    "The robot starts at `(0, 0)`, the algorithm sorts the packages so that `x` and `y` are non-decreasing, the first package will satisfy the condition `x_1 >= 0` and `y_1 >= 0`.\n",
    "- The algorithm adds the required `R` (right) and `U` (up) moves to reach `(x_1, y_1)` from `(0, 0)`.\n",
    "- If `x_1 < 0` or `y_1 < 0`, then the package is unreachable from `(0, 0)`, and the algorithm outputs `\"NO\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the robot can reach the first package if and only if the condition `x_1 >= 0` and `y_1 >= 0` holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Inductive Step\n",
    "Assume that up to the `k`-th package `(x_k, y_k)`, the algorithm has constructed a path to reach all previous packages in increasing order.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need to prove that if the algorithm has generated the correct path up to `(x_k, y_k)`, it will also generate the correct path to reach the next package `(x_{k+1}, y_{k+1})`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assumption**:\n",
    "   - Since the packages are sorted in non-decreasing order by `x` and `y`, we know that:\n",
    "     - $( x_{k+1} \\geq x_k )$\n",
    "     - $( y_{k+1} \\geq y_k )$\n",
    "   - This ensures that to move from `(x_k, y_k)` to `(x_{k+1}, y_{k+1})`, the robot only needs to move right or up, complying with the movement constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Absurd**:\n",
    "   - If `(x_{k+1}, y_{k+1})` were to the left or below `(x_k, y_k)` (i.e., `x_{k+1} < x_k` or `y_{k+1} < y_k`), the algorithm would terminate and return `\"NO\"` because moving back is not allowed.\n",
    "   - However, since the packages are sorted, this situation cannot occur. This guarantees that, for any `k`, it’s always possible to move from the current package to the next one with only `R` and `U` moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Path**:\n",
    "   - At each step, the algorithm calculates the number of steps required to move right (`R`) and up (`U`) to reach the next package.\n",
    "   - By accumulating these moves, the `path` correctly represents the path between each pair of consecutive packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if the robot can reach all packages up to `(x_k, y_k)` in sequence, it can also reach `(x_{k+1}, y_{k+1)` correctly, continuing to build the path optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Conclusion of the Proof**\n",
    "Then by induction, the algorithm constructs the correct path up to each successive package,"

    "\n",
    "1. **Reading Input for `t` Test Cases**  \n",
    "   The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. Since each test case operates independently, we can analyze the complexity of a single test case and multiply by `t` at the end.\n",
    "\n",

    "   For each test case, we read `n` pairs of integers representing the coordinates `(x, y)` of the packages.  \n",
    "   - **Time complexity for reading input**:$( O(n) )$  \n",
    "     Each coordinate pair is added to the list `pkg` in constant time.\n",

    "   - For each package, we check if moving to its coordinates is possible and, if so, calculate the steps needed to reach it.\n",

    "5. **Outputting the Result**  \n",
